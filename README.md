## *About Me*

Hi ðŸ‘‹, My name is Ashmin Bhujel. I'm an aspiring software developer from Nepal ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡µ. Currently I'm exploring and learning the frontend realm of the web development. I get fascinated by the micro-interactions and animations that we can make in a website using the tools like [CSS transitions](https://web.dev/learn/css/transitions) and [animations](https://web.dev/learn/css/animations), [GSAP](https://gsap.com/), [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/), etc.
